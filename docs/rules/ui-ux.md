# Livewire UI/UX and Theme

## UI source and selection

Use the installed active theme. `docs/template/<theme>/` is the complete upstream vendor bundle: paste its `assets/` and HTML there unchanged. Runtime starter Blade remains in `resources/themes/<theme>/views/starter/`; runtime assets remain in `public/themes/<theme>/assets/`. The bundle's `template.md` is a non-binding search atlas, not a design checklist.

1. Identify the page goal, data type/volume, statuses, primary action, and required interaction.
2. Search the atlas with context plus component terms using `rg`; choose 3–5 candidates and open only 1–3 closest HTML sources.
3. Compare hierarchy and information density, then compose the closest active-theme pattern. Search targeted preview/shared/template documentation only when the atlas is insufficient.
4. Never read the whole atlas/template tree or design from personal taste.

When introducing a new theme, first paste its vendor distribution intact into `docs/template/<theme>/`; then generate the starter Blade contract in `resources/themes/<theme>/views/starter/`, copy required runtime assets to `public/themes/<theme>/assets/`, register the three paths and PowerGrid adapter in `config/starter.php`, and verify `starter:publish-assets`, the active layout, modal, auth/error pages, and PowerGrid.

## Base rules

- The starter owns shell layout, account dropdown, auth, lock screen, and error pages. Project features extend only the documented extension paths; never copy or override core views.
- The permitted global extension contracts are `resources/views/extensions/starter/header-actions/index.blade.php`, `profile-menu/index.blade.php`, `layout/head.blade.php`, and `layout/body-end.blade.php`. Extensions add content; they never replace starter layouts/views.
- Use Indonesian UI text, sensible information density, visible status, empty/loading/error states, keyboard-accessible controls, and responsive layouts.
- Prefer the existing theme component and a small local Alpine interaction. Add a library only after proving the theme/vanilla alternatives cannot meet the need; keep it local, page-scoped, compatible, idempotent, and cleaned up on navigation.
- Livewire handles server state, validation, authorization, transactions, and audit. Alpine/JavaScript handles presentation-only state (toggle, show/hide, tab, dropdown, copy, local preview). Do not issue Livewire requests for presentation-only work.
- Normal forms use deferred binding and submit validation. Use live server requests only for a demonstrated immediate need (authoritative dependent values, unique checks, autocomplete, upload/preview), with narrow scope, limits, and final submit validation.
- Search/filter requests are live and debounced around 300–500 ms when they query. Ordinary input changes must not show the global action loader. Polling/passive refresh must preserve content, filters, pagination, focus, and scroll.

## PowerGrid table standard

- Every Livewire table uses `power-components/livewire-powergrid` and the active-theme adapter. Data sources, search, filters, sorting, pagination, selection, and bulk/by-filter mutations are server-side.
- Enable a type-appropriate per-column filter by default for every meaningful data column. Text columns use live text filtering; enum/relation/boolean columns use suitable option controls; numeric columns use an appropriate range/value control; date/datetime columns always provide inclusive **from** and **to** filters. Exclude only columns for which filtering is genuinely meaningless (for example actions, derived/audit-only/system metadata), document the reason, and test it.
- Column filters query live—debounced where needed—without an Apply/Search button. Persist filter/sort/search state across reload using the supported PowerGrid/Livewire URL or session mechanism; reset pagination only when filtering/sorting scope changes.
- An above-grid one-row filter card is optional. Use it only for cross-column, composite, or high-value filters that are not represented by a column filter. Never repeat a column filter in the card.
- Size columns for the filter control and expected content, not arbitrary equal widths. Keep headers/values readable and consistent at desktop and mobile sizes; wrap deliberately where useful and use `table-responsive`/horizontal scrolling for wide tables.
- Muteable entity tables include select-all, validated bounded bulk actions, by-filter actions, and complete lifecycle controls unless excluded by the domain/audit rules. Dangerous or broad actions require accurate scope/count and explicit confirmation.
- Tables with horizontally long content must be placed in a full-width container (single column layout) to minimize horizontal scrolling. Always wrap tables inside a white background card.
- Place `Column::action('Aksi')` first in `columns()` so PowerGrid renders the action column immediately after its automatically prepended checkbox column. Use the label `Aksi`, never `Aksi Massal` or another variation.
- Group every row action in one borderless, icon-only trigger with `aria-label="Aksi"`; dropdown items retain clear text labels. Use Alpine (`x-data`, `@click`, and related state) instead of Bootstrap `data-bs-toggle="dropdown"`, and render the menu through `x-teleport="body"` to avoid clipping and table-overflow/z-index problems during Livewire DOM morphing.
- Date and datetime columns use range filters. Apply `->params(['mode' => 'range'])` to the relevant `Filter::datepicker` or `Filter::datetimepicker`, then preserve and test inclusive from/to boundaries.
- Global PowerGrid/Tabler styling and shared translations belong in the starter theme/runtime assets. Do not duplicate those fixes in individual tables.

## Form, modal, and feedback behavior

- Keep action controls near their relevant content. Use the closest theme form, card, modal, alert, badge, empty-state, and pagination patterns.
- Browser-native dialogs are forbidden: do not use `alert`, `confirm`, `prompt`, or their equivalents. Every dialog is an active-template, theme-consistent modal. Every user-action confirmation uses this modal and states the action, affected scope/count, irreversible impact when applicable, and a clear cancel/confirm choice. Destructive, broad, archive/restore, and permanent-delete actions require this confirmation before the server mutation.
- Use a modal for a compact, single-purpose mini form that can be completed without losing page context. Keep it focused, accessible, and short; validation errors remain in the modal and inputs preserve state. A complex, multi-step, large, or page-defining form must use a dedicated page rather than an oversized modal.
- Every modal must be closable by clicking anywhere on the backdrop (outside the modal dialog). For modals managed manually via Livewire (e.g., using a boolean property and `d-block`), ensure `wire:click.self` is applied to the outermost `.modal` element to capture backdrop clicks.
- For long forms that require vertical scrolling (exceeding one viewport), the primary action button (Submit/Save) must be easily accessible without scrolling to the bottom. Use either a sticky/floating action bar at the bottom or dual submit buttons (one in the Page Header and one at the bottom of the form).
- Modal state must resolve before a global loader takes focus. Show validation next to the field and preserve submitted state on validation failures.
- Use the existing runtime loader for explicit user actions. Do not add duplicate loaders, global DOM manipulation, or `wire:ignore` except for an isolated third-party widget controlled outside Livewire.
- Livewire navigation is only for guaranteed same-origin URLs. Root/auth/App-subdomain navigation must use normal browser navigation; do not solve cross-origin navigation with CORS.
- Error pages for `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `405`, `408`, `419`, `422`, `429`, `500`, `503`, and fallback `4xx`/`5xx` use `resources/themes/<theme>/views/starter/errors/layout.blade.php`, Indonesian text, safe return action, `noindex`, and no internal exception/path/query/credential disclosure.

## Assets

- Core theme/runtime/Livewire/Alpine assets remain local in `public/assets`, loaded once by the layout. No CDN for basic UI or common libraries.
- Keep page CSS/JS at `resources/views/apps/<subdomain>/<module>/assets/<page>.(css|js).blade.php`; include it only from its owner view. Use `@assets` for Livewire dependencies and `@script` for Livewire initialization; non-Livewire pages use the provided stacks.
- Third-party assets remain local and page-scoped in `public/assets/apps/<subdomain>/vendor/`. Use `defer` for non-critical scripts, avoid duplicate bundles, and use version tracking when a changed asset must reload.
- Do not use `data-navigate-once` on page assets/scripts; it is reserved for global singleton runtime. Use `data-navigate-track` for a versioned asset that must force a reload. Keep jQuery exceptional, local, page-scoped, ordered as jQuery → library → initialization, deferred without `async`, and isolate its DOM with `wire:ignore` only when it owns that DOM.
- A non-hostable third-party SDK requires approved feature rationale, a pinned version, `defer`, and a non-user-controlled URL. Production must not require a Node/Vite server unless built source is actually used.

## Browser verification

- Test menu entry, redirects, primary actions, loaders, modal/toast/validation states, empty/low/high data volumes, and relevant desktop/laptop/mobile widths.
- For PowerGrid, test live global and per-column filtering, date from/to boundaries, persisted reload state, sort, pagination/last page, empty result, and role-specific scope.
- For CSS changes, verify normal, focus, invalid, and invalid+focus states; inspect DOM/computed style when a screenshot is inconclusive.

## Safe Area Resolution

- Dalam mengatur tata letak (layout) komponen UI, selalu mengacu pada resolusi **1280x768** sebagai titik aman (safe area) agar tampilan tetap proporsional dan tidak terpotong pada berbagai layar.
